what is machine learning?
machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence it focuses mainly on designing systems there by alowing them to learn and mAke predictions based on some 
experience which is data in case of some machines.
artificial intelligence----->a technique which enables machine to mimic human behaviour

machine learning------>subset of AI technique which use statistical methods to enables machine to improve with experience

deep learning------>subset of machine learning make the computation of multi-layer neural network feasible

how does machine learning work??
1.training data
2.train the ml algorithm(labelled or unlabelled data)-------------------------
3.model input data                                                           |
----> we pass an input here 4.ml algorithm                                   |
5.prediction(for accuracy)                                                   |
6.successful model (if it is not successful its trained again and again)-----

MACHINE LEARNING TYPES
1.supervised learning---input variable x and output variable y and we use an algorithm to learn mapping function from input to output i.e y equal affects the goal is
to approximate mapping function so well that whenever we have a new input data x, we could predict the output variable y for data
---->where each instances of a training data set is composed of different input attribute and an expected output inputs can be any kind of data
SUPERVISED LEARNING ALGORITHMS---->1.linear regression
                                   2.support vector machines
                                   3.random forest
Supervised Learning:
_______________________________________________________________
In supervised learning, we are given a data set and already know what our correct output should look like, having the idea that there is a relationship between the input and the output.

Supervised learning problems are categorized into "regression" and "classification" problems. In a regression problem, we are trying to predict results within a continuous output, meaning that we are trying to map input variables to some continuous function. In a classification problem, we are instead trying to predict results in a discrete output. In other words, we are trying to map input variables into discrete categories.

Example 1:

Given data about the size of houses on the real estate market, try to predict their price. Price as a function of size is a continuous output, so this is a regression problem.

We could turn this example into a classification problem by instead making our output about whether the house "sells for more or less than the asking price." Here we are classifying the houses based on price into two discrete categories.

Example 2:

(a) Regression - Given a picture of a person, we have to predict their age on the basis of the given picture

(b) Classification - Given a patient with a tumor, we have to predict whether the tumor is malignant or benign.

2.unsupervised learning:
______________________________
---where we have only input data x and no corresponding output variable.is to model the unsupervised learning structutre or distribution in data in
order to learn more about data.it will make clusters depending on inputs.
UNSUPERVISED LEARNING ALGORITHMS--->1.apriori algorithms
                                    2.hierarchial algorithm
                                    3.k-means algorithm
Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning allows us to approach problems with little or no idea what our results should look like. We can derive structure from data where we don't necessarily know the effect of the variables.

We can derive this structure by clustering the data based on relationships among the variables in the data.

With unsupervised learning there is no feedback based on the prediction results.

Example:

Clustering: Take a collection of 1,000,000 different genes, and find a way to automatically group these genes into groups that are somehow similar or related by different variables, such as lifespan, location, roles, and so on.

Non-clustering: The "Cocktail Party Algorithm", allows you to find structure in a chaotic environment. (i.e. identifying individual voices and music from a mesh of sounds at a cocktail party).

3.reinforcemnt learning---which allows software agents and machine to automatically determine the ideal behaviour within a specific context to maximize its perfomance.
simply it learns from mistakes if it say wrong answer negative marks will be rewarded.interaction between 2 elements ->the learning agent leverages to mechanism namely 
1.exploration --->trial and error basis
exploitation --->gains from environment
